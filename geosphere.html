          <p> Due to its solid nature, the geosphere is a dynamic sphere where the surface is in constant motion. This movement creates continents, oceans, and their landforms through a process called Plate Tectonics!</p>

          <p>Geosphere is what makes up the interior and surface of the Earth and is made up of rocks. It includes both the continental and oceanic crust as well as other layers of the Earthâ€™s interior.</p><br><br>
      <p>There are three different parts of the Geosphere:</p>
      <p>* 		Crust - Made up of different types of minerals and rocks.</p>
      <p>* 		Mantle - Can be found below the crust and has two parts. The less dense upper mantle (also known as the asthenosphere) and the denser and thicker lower mantle.</p>
      <p>* 		Core - The portion that lies beneath the mantle. The outer core, which is the liquid part, has a thickness of 2250 km while the inner core or the solid part is 1220 km.</p>
