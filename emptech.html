  <h2>Introduction:</h2>
  <h2>Our Planet</h2>
  <p>Why is the Earth important? <br><br>
- Our home resides on Earth. We depend on it in many different ways for our survival. Our needs are met by its
resources, which also supply the things we need to live. Human societies and the development of civilization 
have been profoundly impacted by even small changes to Earth's systems.
<br><br>
Why is Earth habitable?<br><br>
- It is at the proper distance from the Sun, has a magnetic field that shields it from solar radiation, has an 
insulating atmosphere that keeps it warm, and contains the correct chemistry for life, including carbon and 
water 
<br><br>
What are four major subsystems of earth?<br><br>
- They are the "lithosphere" (land), "hydrosphere" (water), "biosphere" (living things), and "atmosphere" (air), 
and collectively they are referred to as "spheres." There are also sub-spheres within each of these four 
spheres.
<br><br>
- These subsystems are linked together by cycles and processes that, over time, in occasional ways that are in 
accordance with the laws of conservation of matter and energy, store, transform, and/or transport matter and 
energy throughout the whole Earth system.
