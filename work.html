    <h3>RENEWABLE RESOURCES</h3>
    <p>1.) Water
          - Mostly what Earth is made up of, water is a vital source for every living organism on Earth. Water that is both fresh and clean is essential to our survival because it is needed not just for drinking but also for sanitation, irrigating crops, supporting livestock like poultry and industries, and even establishing and maintaining ecosystems. Although it may seem as if the Earth is surrounded by water, humans cannot use all of it. Studies show that only 1% of the Earth’s water is consumable by humans. Water is also used as hydropower just by harnessing its energy.</p>
          
         <p>2.) Sunlight
          - Plants need sunlight as it is what they need in order to grow. Humans, as well as animals, need the oxygen plants produced to live. The Earth would freeze without the sun's heat. For the movement of water, there wouldn't be any winds, ocean currents, or clouds. Sunlight is necessary for life on Earth. It is essential in our existence, from providing energy to plants and animals to modulating our circadian cycles and supporting good skin.</p>
         <p>3.) Soil
          - Also called the “fragile skin of the Earth”. Soil is a mixture including minerals, organic metals, and living organisms. One of the important elements in Earth as it contains both the biotic factor that is present for plants to grow and the abiotic factor. The soil contains water and stores nutrients. Thus, this is why soil is considered as the life support system. Because soil is rich in minerals that are employed in different industries, it is capable of being used in the agricultural sector, construction and building, ecological services, pottery and ceramics, healthcare, and even beauty items if handled correctly.</p>

    <h3>NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES</h3>
    <p>1.) Coal 
          - Coal is a type of sedimentary rock. It is a prominent nonrenewable fuel that is mostly used in the generation of power. It is classified as a fossil fuel as it is formed from decaying plant matter. The quality of coal is determined by how it was generated; as biological matter is subjected to higher heat and pressure, the carbon concentration increases. Coal is typically used in generating electricities, production of steel, and other domestic use. In production, coal can be used in transportations as its raw products such as aluminum and steel are used in manufacturing transport structures. Coals, if used correctly, can be used in medicines as many essential compounds are produced by the destructive distillation of coal. </p>
          
          <p>2.) Petroleum
          - A type of fossil fuel that is commonly found in geological formation beneath the Earth’s surface, petroleum is a naturally occurring liquid refined to produce various types of fuels. Petroleum is used in agriculture as fertilizers as the ammonia of the petroleum serves as the source of nitrogen for the plants and crops. Plastics such as nylon or styrofoam are a common type of plastics made from petroleum-based plastics. Some products that are being used by humans daily that are made from petroleum are: ink, vitamin capsules, denture adhesives, toilet seats CDs, pillows, guitar strings, and aspirin.</p>

    <h3>IMPORTANCE OF EARTH'S RESOURCES</h3>
  <p>In the end, natural resources are the source of all things in our way of life.  Coal, oil, soil, water, land, minerals, forests and timber, and the air we breathe are a few examples. The importance of natural resources on earth cannot be overstated. Because of this, it's crucial that we all take responsibility for our actions and protect and respect the environment.
  </p>
  <p>Here are few reasons listed below which will through light regarding the importance of natural resources and the need to conserve them:
  </p>
<p>1. Nature helps in upholding environmental harmony and providing for all requirements.</p>
<p>2. In order to produce goods and make medicines, a vast variety of industrial materials and biological components from plants and animals are used, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>3. Resources are capital that has been turned into commodities inputs for capital-intensive infrastructure processes.</p>
<p>4. The "3R Concept" stands for "REDUCE," "REUSE," and "RECYCLE."</p>
<p>5. Any country's development depends on its resources. For instance, fossil fuels are needed to produce energy, and mineral resources are needed to advance industrial development.</p>
